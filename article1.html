Ok, there are two styles that people follow generally. The first is the G style and the second is the L style, or I would like to call them so.<br/>
In the G style you want to be holding as shown in the figure alongside. Your four fingers are folded into the ridge of the frisbee, i.e. your fingers are on the inside of the ridge. You can choose if you want to place them on the bottom side of the disc or not. Your palm can be along the side of the ridge. Again you don’t want your palm on the top surface. Next your thumb’s position is very important. It should be on top of the ridge and the top part of your thumb can be on the top surface of the frisbee. Your thumb is the only part of your hand gripping on the top side. You want to have a good grip of the frisbee, but if you are using a rubber frisbee you don’t want to be holding it too tight, because holding too tight will bend it. For that matter, even while using a hard disc you don’t want to hold it too tight as it will strain your fingers. After some practice the grip will come more easily, but initially it will feel awkward griping it like this. But, personally I feel this grip gives more control and accuracy.<br/>

Then we have the L style. This style will be easier to hold. It comes very naturally, when you are starting. In this style, you have three finger on the inner side of the ridge or the bottom surface of the disc. They are exactly as you would hold using the G style. But the difference is your index finger. Your index finger is pointing along the ridge as shown in the figure alongside. This modification makes holding the frisbee much more comfortable. Again your thumb is on the top surface of the frisbee. Not too tight. What you will notice though is when your index is out, your palm feels more open. And from what I have noticed, this affects your grip and control. For each person its different, as to what part of their palm should touch the side of the ridge. I like it a little closer to my thumb, but it purely depends on what works for you. This style will be more comfortable, but again from my experience it requires more practice to get accuracy. If you are a beginner, you can start with this style, but I recommend you move onto using the G style.<br/>
Now you must be wondering why I call these two styles as G and L. In the first style, your thumb and four fingers form a kind of G shape. Whereas in the second style your thumb and index form an L, but ideally you don’t want them to be perfectly perpendicular. If you don’t agree with why I call them this way, you are more than welcome to name them however you feel and if you do feel your name is more apt, please let me know.<br/><br/>

<h3>The release</h3>
Now coming to the main part, the release. There are so many ways to throw a frisbee. But I will be telling you how to throw it straight to your target. For this, the main point is you want your frisbee perfectly flat and parallel to the ground. To achieve this, your release is very important.<br/>
First you want to be standing comfortably. You can keep your feet slightly apart and you can bend your knees just a bit so that your stance is firm. Your stance should be sideways. This means that your target is on the side of your throwing arm. Your throwing arm shoulder should face the target. Then take your aim. Fold your throwing arm in towards your body. Bring the frisbee close to your chest. Make sure the frisbee is parallel to the ground. If you are using the G grip, then you will find that your wrist is slightly turned and it might be a little uncomfortable to begin with. This is alright.<br/>
Now when your releasing, you will be using your arm and your wrist. The motion is to extend your arm in one smooth flow along with snapping your wrist outward as your arm straightens out. You can snap your wrist when your arm is almost straightened. As soon as you have snapped your wrist, let go of the frisbee and let it sail. The extension of arm gives you most of the power behind the throw. Snapping the wrist gives the frisbee the rotation and a bit of power as well. While extending your arm make sure the frisbee is flat and parallel to the ground throughout. Only with a flat throw, your frisbee will go straight. Now depending upon how much force you give while extending your arm and how fast you snap your wrist, the distance travelled by the frisbee and the speed is determined. Quite obviously, the more force you give, the further the frisbee travels. One common mistake made when giving more force is that you tend to tilt the frisbee when extending your arms. This will result in your frisbee going in a curved path and not to your desired target.
Getting the height at which you want it to go requires more practice. This throwing technique generally keeps the frisbee at a height that is comfortable to catch. <br/>
So good luck, and let me know if you are facing any troubles. Keep practicing and you should get the hang of it in no time. Once you get this you can experiment with other throwing styles, curving the frisbee and much much more.
