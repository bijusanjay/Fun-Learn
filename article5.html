	<h3>What is Literature:</h3>
	<p>Ok, you must be wondering what does he mean by <i>“play literature”</i>??? You would have heard of reading literature, or writing literature, but playing? For those of you who are wondering, literature is a card game. It is best played with six people, although other numbers are possible.<br/>
	First of all its not a gambling game, its just a fun game.</p>
	<h3>How to Play:</h3>
	<h4>What You Need:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Six Players</li>
		<li>One deck of Cards</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Set Up:</h4>
	<p>Remove all Jokers and 8s from the deck. You should be left with 48 cards.<p/>
	<h4>Rules:</h4>
	<img src="lit1.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;width:300px"/>
	<p>The rules to the game are simple. Now that the 8s are removed we are left with 2,3,…,7 and 9,10,J,Q,K, and A of the four suits. Now in each suit we have what is called a minor set and a major set. Minor set of a suit is the 2,3,4,5,6,7 of that suit. And the major set is 9,10,J,Q,K,A of that suit. So for example 5 spades belongs to the minor spades. Jack of hearts belongs to the major hearts. So in all we have 8 sets, 4 majors and 4 minors.<br/>
	Now the six members split into two teams of three each. Then you sit down in a circle alternatingly. Which means, each person’s neighbour is his/her opponent. Make sure you have enough space in between each other so as to not reveal your cards. Also looking into others cards will only spoil the game.<br/>
	Shuffle the cards well and deal them out. Each player will get 8 cards to begin with. You can choose who starts the game. It can be anybody. The person who starts the game can ask any one of his three opponents for a card. The conditions for asking are very simple. The person asking can’t ask for his/her own card.  And you can only ask for cards from a set for which you already possess.</p>
	<h6>Example:</h6>
	<p>Cards that I have: 2S, 5S, 9S, JC, KH, AH, 5D, 7D.<br/>
	Therefore I have card(s) from the minor spades, major spades, major clubs, major hears and minor diamonds. Hence I can only ask my opponents for cards from these sets.<br/>
	<img src="silent_emoji.png" style="float:right; margin-left:5px;"/> 
	Once a player has asked his opponent for a card, if the opponent has the card, he has to give it. The person that just received this card can now ask any of his three opponents again, not necessarily from the same set. Now if the opponent doesn’t have the requested card, the turn passes to him/her and its their turn to ask. If a player asks for his/her own card, they have to show everyone immediately that they asked for their own card and the turn passes to whomever was being asked.<br/>
	
	<b>The most important rule is apart from the asking there is no talking allowed. Which means no talking absolutely, by anybody.</b><br/>
	<img src="listen.jpg" style="float:left; margin:10px; margin-left:0px;width:300px"/>
	Now you want collect as many sets as a team and declare them. So how do you do this. From when the game starts, you have to listen to what your team mates are asking for and what sets they are collecting. So when your turn comes, if you have that set you can support them. Also if they are collecting a set, you can narrow down what card they had initially from the set.<br/>
	
	Listening to what opponents are asking is also very important. They are the ones looting your sets from your team mates. If you have a card form that set, you should wait for your turn to take back what was lost. If you don’t pay attention and ask for a card, that your opponent doesn’t have, your turn is lost and you can get looted to. Hence, listening and remembering what cards each player has is the essence of this game.<br/>
	Now you must be wondering how do you win this game. That’s where declaring a set comes. As you know by now, a set has 6 cards. When you have all six cards, on your turn, you can declare the set. When declaring, you place all six card of the set in the center of the circle facing up. But more often then not, you won’t have all six cards from the set. As I mentioned earlier, you have to collect sets as a team. So at some point in the game, when you are confident that the entire set is amongst your team, on your turn you can declare the set. But the catch to this is you can’t just say that your team has the set. You have to exactly tell, which team member has which card(s) of the set. And when declaring, the entire set has to be declared. Again this is where listening and remembering is really required. <br/>
	<h6>Example:</h6>
	You are declaring the major spades. You have placed the A,10, and 9 down. Now you have to tell that <i>“team mate one has the Q spades”</i> and <i>“team mate 2 has the K,J spades.”</i><br/>
	If you tell everything correctly, you have a successful declaration, and your turn continues. A successful declaration of a major set is two points and that of a minor set is one point. If all the cards from the set were with your team, but you declared, then that set is void and zero points are given. The cards from that set are kept in the center face down. If one or more cards are with the opponent team, then they get the set and the respective points. The turn goes to the last player who asked the person who attempted the declaration.<br/>
	In the event that a person’s cards are all over, only he/she is out of the game. If after declaring, you don’t have any cards, any of the other team members can take the turn. If one team has completely finished all their cards, the last person to have asked should do the declarations for all the sets that he/she has. After that if any set remains with the other player, they can declare it.<br/>
	The team with the most points after all declarations wins. So go ahead and play this game in the right spirit. Please don’t cheat, although it will be very tempting.<br/>
