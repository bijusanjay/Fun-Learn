		<p>Unlike a basketball, a volleyball has a much smoother surface which can make it easily slip off. But at the same time it’s much lighter, which reduces the load on your finger.</p>
		<h3>Starting:</h3>
		<p>So how to do it? First make sure your nails are cut. This does help. Then hold the ball with all five fingers spread apart. Don’t let your palm touch the ball. Get a feel of the ball. Now lift the ball up. You want to keep your elbow bent and the ball at about your face level. Try to keep your hand as much to the bottom of the ball as possible. If it is towards one side, the ball will not spin perfectly horizontal. You want your palm and finger facing up always. Start with your fingertips pointing towards you.<br/>
		First you have to just practice tossing the ball and spinning it. Try to toss it not too high, not too low. With practice, you will find a comfortable height. Turn your wrist 180 degrees in a quick smooth flick. Along with this toss the ball. Common mistake while turning your wrist is your palm doesn’t stay facing up. It tends to tilt. Try to make sure that the ball spins perfectly horizontal.</p>

		<h3>Spinning it:</h3>
		<p>Once you have practiced tossing a few times, you can move on to the next step. Toss the ball, then catch it on your index finger. You have to get your finger exactly at the center bottom of the ball. This step requires practice. Once you have caught the ball, make sure you are spinning it at a height that is comfortable for you. <br/>		
		To keep the ball spinning tap the ball on its side along the side its already spinning. You don't want to knock out the ball from your finger. The tap should just be enough to keep the ball spinning.<p/>
