		<h3>The Ripstik:</h3>
		<img src="ripstik1.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; margin-left:10px;">
		<p>The Ripstik or Caster board may look somewhat like a skate board, but I can tell you it’s completely different. The main difference being it doesn’t require you to keep kicking the floor and pushing. From the figure you can see that the ripstik has two surfaces on the top. This is where your feet will be placed. The more pointed one is the front, and the other the back. The two surfaces are connected by a single rod. Below each surface is a wheel.<br/>
		Ripstiks are available online on Flipkart, Amazon, etc. They are also available in Decathlon.</p>
		<h3>How to Start:</h3>
		<p>Initially it doesn’t make any sense, how this thing can possibly move. So you don’t want to take any risks if this is your first attempt. I recommend you to wear a helmet, and knee guards. Most important thing is you want a dry flat surface to ride on. Start off by placing the ripstik on the floor near a railing (or a wall). Place it parallel to the railing. Make sure that you don’t have any object that can get in the way. First you want to practice just getting balance. Believe me initially it can be really hard, but you can pick it up in a few attempts. Face the railings and hold on to the railings, then place your either leg on either surface, so that they are perpendicular to the railings. You can try a few times and figure out which leg is comfortable in front for you. After getting on, you just want to stay there for some time. This step is obviously only while you are learning. To move, you  have to move your feet back and forth, i.e. in lines perpendicular to the railing. This motion is very unnatural at the beginning. So I have kept this video just for the leg motion alone. Once you start doing this action, the ripstik’s physics will make it move forward. Make sure you hold on to the railing for the first few times. You can slowly increase your speed by going through the leg motions quicker.</p>

		<h3>After a Little Practice:</h3>
		<p>After you have been able to successfully move forward bit by bit with the help of the railing, you can slowly take your hands off. But until you’ve gotten comfortable, try to stay close to the railings, to always hold on if you feel like you are going to fall. And if you do fall, you are not the first person. In fact when I first learnt, I fell a lot of times. But, that shouldn’t stop you. In a few more tries you should be able to move forward with much more ease. After that you can do it without the railing completely. Keep your front leg on the board and then kick off with the back leg. Then bring your back foot to its place and off you go<br/>
		By now, you would have noticed, how the turning works on a ripstik. Yes, it is tilting the boards. This is what makes you fall, this is what makes the ripstik so different from a skate board, but this is also what makes you be able to take narrow turnings. So don’t worry. I will teach you how to make turns on the ripstik. So very simply putting it, the side you tilt the front board, that’s the direction the board turns. Or the side that you tilt the back board, the opposite side the board turns.<br/>		
		Let’s take that your front leg is your left leg and your back leg is your right leg. For those who are comfortable with the opposite, take the opposite. So if you want to turn left, you want to push your left heal down, therefore tilting the front board left. If you want to turn right, press your left toes down, to tilt the front board right. Now most important thing is while tilting, you want to tilt back, to straighten again. Or else, you will just be turning. Turning is the hardest part, so at first you want to just  tilt very slightly. Take larger arcs. But make sure you have enough space. Once you are able to make a large circles, all you need is more time with ripstik to get the narrower curves. <br/>
		This is personally for me one of my favourite go to activities. It gives so much joy. And if you have any doubts, you can leave always ask on the suggestions, or you can always mail me directly as well.<br/></p>
